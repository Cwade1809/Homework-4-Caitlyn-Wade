## Homework 4- Caitlyn Wade

I decided to look into the Spaceships subreddit

```{r}
#Loading packages needed
library(tidyverse)
install.packages("RedditExtractoR")
library(RedditExtractoR)
install.packages("tm")
install.packages("wordcloud")
library(tm)


#Attempting to find an interesting subreddit to use
find_subreddits("nasa")
#subreddit chosen: "Spaceships"

top_spaceship_urls <- find_thread_urls(subreddit = "Spaceships", sort_by = "top")
write_rds(top_spaceship_urls, "top_spaceship_urls.rds")

spaceship_no_stop <- tm_map(spaceship, removeWords, stopwords("english"))

spaceship_wordcount <- spaceship_no_stop |>
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

user <- "Spaceship"
spaceship_user <- get_user_content(user)
str(spaceship_user[[user]]$about)

#the following 2 lines of code wouldn't run when I tried to render, it got stuck in the loading stage every time, because of this, I can write the code for the rest of this section of the assignment, but it may not be able to run
mycomments <- spaceship_user[[user]]$comments
mycomments <- tibble(mycomments)

pluckcomments <- pluck(spaceship_user, "Spaceship")

mycomments_no_stop <- tm_map(mycomments, removeWords, stopwords("english"))

mycomments_wordcount <- mycomments_no_stop |>
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```
